The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n\n* A vocabulary of known words.\n\n* A measure of the presence of known words.\n\nWhy is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n\nThe intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n\nFor example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n\n\n### TF-IDF Approach\nA problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.\n\nOne approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:\n\n**Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.**\n\n```\nTF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)\n```\n\n**Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.**\n\n```\nIDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n```\n### Cosine Similarity\n\nTf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus\n\n```\nCosine Similarity (d1, d2) =  Dot product(d1, d2) / ||d1|| * ||d2||\n```\nwhere d1,d2 are two non zero vectors.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To generate a response from our bot for input questions, the concept of document similarity will be used.
