The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[6] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[7][8] As of 1 April 2020, more than 859,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 42,000 deaths.[5] More than 178,000 people have recovered.[5]

The virus is mainly spread by fomites and, during close contact, by respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze.[9][10][11] Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but the virus is not generally airborne.[9][10][12][9][11] It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.[11] The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from 2 to 14 days.[13][14] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.[13] Complications may include viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[15] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[16] Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][17]

Efforts to prevent the virus spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include the quarantine of Hubei,[18] national or regional quarantines elsewhere in the world, curfew measures in China and South Korea,[19][20][21] various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions,[22][23] screening at airports and train stations,[24] and outgoing passenger travel bans.[25][26][27][28]

The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption,[29] the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, and cultural events,[30] and widespread fears of supply shortages resulting in panic buying.[31][32] Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in more than 160 countries, affecting more than 1.5 billion students.[33] Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have spread online[34][35] and there have been incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese and other East and Southeast Asian people and, as the disease spread, to European people.[36][37][38]
